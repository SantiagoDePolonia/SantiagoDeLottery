# SantiagoDeLottery - Lottery smart contract created by Santiago de Polonia


### TODO
- optimisation - using smaller variable types. Does uint256 is necessary everywhere?
- using less deterministic randomness (perhaps this provided by chainlink oracle)
- making the lottery draw term more deterministic (every Sunday at 1 pm CET if the players exist ?)
